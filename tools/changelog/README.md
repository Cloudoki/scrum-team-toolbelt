# The changelog

The agile sprint CI-CD flow is straight forward. Each ending collects a variable number (can be zero) of proposed changes to the project repositories.  This collection -a.k.a. the "changelog"- has 4 (!) metamorphoses in its lifetime.
First, it is your reference list for the sprint review demo. This is usually the longest version of the list.
Second, it becomes the short-list of all new features, improvements and refactors avaluated on quality. Some changes won't make the north end of the cut.
Third, the eventual lifetime of the changelog is the final cut of changes that made the upcycle release. Remarkeably, some entries might move from unsuccessful to successful again, for multiple reasons. Pride of a developer who couldn't resist a weekend nightly, the business Sponsor considering some change "well that's good enough", ...
Lastly, your changelog will be cloned into the perpetual next sprint, because some changes fail and need to be picked up again. This is a normal process, don't feel bad about it (that's the job of your Scrum Master).

Albeit considered a technical document, the changelog is best conserved if it has received some attention for readibilty. In rare moment you might find yourself digging for an old copy.

> A good change log sticks to these principles:
> * It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.
> * Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).
> * One sub-section per version.
> * List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
> * Write all dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Example: 2012-06-02 for June 2nd, 2012.) It’s international, sensible, and language-independent.
> * Explicitly mention whether the project follows Semantic Versioning.
> * Each version should Group changes to describe their impact on the project
