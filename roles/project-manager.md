# Product Manager
`abbreviation: PM`

An internal team's Product Owner when working on external projects/products

> Bridges the gap between an external product's needs and the team's capabilities

## Description
The Project Manager role isÂ a role specifically used when developing products for external clients.

When managing an internal product's team, any changes to the scope, priorities and planning are discussed internally and approved or not. On the other hand, when implementing an external team's project, scope changes that are defined by the product team do not necessarily match the existing colaboration's scope and/or agreement. Here is where Cloudoki brings a Project Manager's capabilities in.

What we loosely refer to as Project Manager is the equivalent to a Product Owner, but at the Cloudoki side. It's role is to understand in great depths both Product's needs as well as the collaboration details. This role will constantly strive to push forward the Product's vision, within the boundaries of what is Cloudoki's responsibility.
