# Engineers
`abbreviation: Tech`

The tech team turning user stories into product features.

> If you are lucky, a well balanced group of juniors to seniors, each playing their vital part in actually getting things done.

> DevOps Engineer. Unfairly depicted as dungeon creatures -they live in the cloud these days- your DevOps is most likely one of the most professional project stakeholders you'll meet.

> Tech lead. The most communicative of your senior engineers. Has to be willing to sacrifice a part of his time to project and people management next to the Scrum Master.
