# The technical roadmap

> A colourful list of blocks just comprehensible enough for all the stakeholders to realise you are needed after all.

I haven't really come across a standardised version on this. Use a dedicated tool, or simply a spreadsheet, with 3 axis: **time**, **team** & **features**.
Depending on the depth one of those 3 will be vertical. In the example file, this happens to be the features.

Define the weight of your block unit (full sprint, half sprint, ...), and break down features to the level where you feel confident to assign sprints to it. The rule of thumb is straight forward. If you are at a level where you need less then half a sprint on average, you've gone too far. If none of your features take less then 2 sprints per unit, break down more.
Obviously, for these assessments you need to have full ownership of the features. Prepare that first, don't feel shy to get better informed by your tech lead later. Don't forget to buffer*.
An average roadmap can span up to 12 months without being the exception. Keep improving your assessment on nearby units, and put on the rough brush for horizon features.

At the end of the day, the stakeholders who would like to do the roadmap assessments for you, should in no way be allowed. The ones who could potentially do a useful job, really will hate you for it. Don't delegate this job.
