# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests and link reference in the series or this file. Please review these guidelines before submitting any requests.

## Guidelines

I would like to invite each member of a product team to document their own journey through a sprint. Here are some helpful pointers to describe your journey:
* Start from a chronological sprint order, so you reader can easily identify with the flow of your journey.
* Don't worry about the length of your article. Start with a single page, only write more if you are enjoying it.
* Reference and link the tools and documents you use, they are inspirational.
* Avoid naming individuals and projects, your journey is the key.
* Elaborate on how your role relates to other team members, so they become motivated to write down their journey as well.
