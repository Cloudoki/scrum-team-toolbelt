## Product stakeholders

 Stakeholders | | |
:-------------------|:-----------|:----
 Sponsor            | business   | Epic owner. The internal customer with half-god status (he requests the budgets). Find the strenghts of your sponsor, in order for the sponsors to enable your product vision with proper impact.
 TSM                | enterprise | Tribe Scrum Master. Only exists in enterprise environments. Also "Chief of Staff" for your Tribe Lead. Good friend if you can, spar with the TSM if you have to - before you bring it to the Tribe Lead.
 Architect          | enterprise | A creature who used to be tech lead, until he got a raise. Feel free to make jokes about that history. Important ally.
 Release Engineer   | enterprise | A special kind of architect, typically with DevOps (see below) background. This profile helps tempering your natural urge to hastily release exciting features, just as he/she is your ally in moderating hotfixes requested by business.
 DevOps             | enterprise | Unfairly depicted as dungeon creatures -they live in the cloud these days- your DevOps is most likely one of the most professional project stakeholders you'll meet.
 PO                 | you        | Product Owner. Sometimes feels as master of ceremony.
 Scrum Master       | squad      | The whip of your team. The Scrum Master is not easily fooled and understands the emotional fluctuations of your team. Many PO's have a scrum mastering history, so you probably understand this position well.
 Tech Lead          | squad      | The most communicative of your senior engineers. Has to be willing to sacrifice a part of his time to project and people management next to the Scrum Master.
 Developer          | squad      | If you are lucky, a wall balanced group of juniors to seniors, each playing their vital part in actually getting things done.
 Functional Analyst | squad      | Former engineer or designer with a weak spot for insights. In case of enterprise structures, delegate trust and responsibilities on intra-company communications and meetings.
 Storyteller        | squad      | The author of the user stories and journeys. Thus also the key unlocking your product vision to everybody else. Of epic importance.
 Designer           | squad      | Simplification of the various creative profiles, from product and graphic designers to UX specialists. Great bunch. Their ultimate weapon is the real-life user report.
 Tester             | squad      | The tester gets empowered most by a wintered PO. By automated end-to-end test journeys, CC Monitoring, spotlighting during sprint reviews and giving them a seat at the CI/CD cycle approval board.
